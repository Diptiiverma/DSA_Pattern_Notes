# DSA_Pattern_Notes
Welcome to my DSA Pattern Learning Series - a structured collection of pattern-based problem- solving notes that I'm building while learning DSA concepts.

🧠 What This Series Focuses On
Instead of random problem solving, this series follows a pattern-first approach —
the same way real-world software systems are designed.

You will find notes and problems based on:

1. Two Pointers
2. Sliding Window
3. Interval Scheduling
4. In-Place Linked List Manipulation
